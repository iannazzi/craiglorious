purchase_orders;default_send_po_email_text;PLEASE NOTE: We are having trouble with some vendors regarding paperwork: Primarily we are missing payment information for accounts on credit card. We need receipts for all charges to credit cards including the date, the last 4 of the card and the invoice number. As many of you know we have about 3000 credit cards, tracking down charges is becoming a full time position. We prefer these receipts for charges be included in shipments, the next best option is a combination of fax/email/mail: 585-383-1172 and accounting@embrasse-moi.com. ;;
